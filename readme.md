# Treehouse Python Project 5 <br> Flask SQLAlchemy Portfolio

This project is a showcase of the use of Flask and SQLAlchemy to create
a website that functions as a show portfolio.

## What I Learned
This was a very interesting project that provided an opportunity to 
combine skills from previous projects in one capstone. The flexibility of Flask
is fantastic and makes for great light-weight website as compared to Django. Flask-SQLAlchemy
does alot of the heavy lifting for database queries allow for a relatively easy process
for incorporating dynamic content into a website. I will definitely be using alot of 
what I learned during this project to build out other projects in the future. 


## Installation / Running

After cloning the project from github, ensure that your local virtual environment contains all 
project dependencies found in the requirements.txt

From the virtual environment you can use app.py as the application entry point.  
> python app.py

This should create a locally run Flask website running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Navigating to this url will launch the site, and then normal link navigation should 
work to get around the site.

You can stop the application by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

## Dependencies

The requirements.txt file should include all necessary dependencies to run this project.
